This module provides a class for creating tokenizers.\n\n\nConstructor\n\n\nThe constructor takes no parameters, so it is very simple to use.\n\n\nT = new Tokenizer();\n\n\n\n\nAdding types to a tokenizer\n\n\nThere is precisely one function for adding types to the tokenizer.  Note,\nhowever, that types are checked in the order in which they were added to the\ntokenizer, so when you call this function repeatedly to add various types of\ntokens, you should take care to order the calls correctly.\n\n\nFor instance, perhaps you are writing a tokenizer for simple algebraic\nexpressions, in which a sequence of letters will be seen as the\nmultiplication of variables (i.e., \"abc\" means \"a times b times c\") except\nfor a few special sequences of letters such as \"sin\" and \"cos\" and \"pi\" and\nperhaps a few others.\n\n\nIt is important to add the tokens for \"sin\" and \"cos\" and so on first, and\nthen the generic single-letter token thereafter, so that the special cases\nhave a chance to be applied before the general case.  Otherwise the general\ncase would catch all sequences of letters, and the special cases would\nnever have a chance to be applied.\n\n\nThe function signature looks like so:\n\n\nT.addType( regexp, formatter );\n\n\n\n\nThe two parameters are documented thoroughly in\n\nthe source code documentation\n, so I do not repeat the information here.\n\n\nTokenizing\n\n\nTo tokenize text, simply call \nT.tokenize( input )\n on the text.\n\n\nExample:\n\n\n\nT = new Tokenizer();\nT.addType( /sin/ );\nT.addType( /cos/ );\nT.addType( /pi/ );\nT.addType( /[a-z]/, function ( name ) { return \"Variable:\" + name; } );\nT.addType( /\\s/, function () { return null; } );\nconsole.log( T.tokenize( 'sin x' ) );\nconsole.log( T.tokenize( 'cospiy' ) );\n\n\n\n\nParsing\n\n\nA grammar is a set of rules defining the language to parse.  For more\ninformation on context-free grammars, see \nthe Wikipedia article on the\nEarley parser\n.\n\n\nFor the sake of having a concrete running example in this section, let's\nassume we want to want to create the extremely simple grammar used as \nan\nexample in that same\narticle\n.  We will make\none modification: we will accept any integer, rather than just the four\ndigits in that example.  Our grammar can thus be summarized as the following\nrules.\n\n\n\n\nP ::= S\n\n\nS ::= S+M | M\n\n\nM ::= M*T | T\n\n\nT ::= any integer\n\n\n\n\nWe can represent the same grammar without the | symbol by separating single\nlines into two separate lines.\n\n\n\n\nP ::= S\n\n\nS ::= S+M\n\n\nS ::= M\n\n\nM ::= M*T\n\n\nM ::= T\n\n\nT ::= any integer\n\n\n\n\nEither way of representing a grammar is acceptable, and supported by this\nmodule.  See \nthe section on specifying grammar\nrules\n, below.\n\n\nConstructor\n\n\nThere is just one constructor for grammars, and it takes as its sole\nargument the name of the start nonterminal.  This need not be a single\ncapital letter, as it is in the example above; nonterminals can have any\nword as their name.\n\n\nG = new Grammar( 'P' );\n\n\n\n\nSetting default options\n\n\nAfter constructing a new grammar, you can choose to set some default options\nthat will govern its behavior.  Any of these can be overridden in any call\nto the parse function, later, but you can set defaults here if you plan to\nneed them often.  You call \nG.setOption( name, value )\n to set the default\nvalue for any option.\n\n\nThe options are documented thoroughly in \nthe source code\ndocumentation\n,\nso I do not repeat that information here.  Examples of the output produced\nby the various options appears in \nthe parsing\nsection\n, below.\n\n\nAdding grammar rules\n\n\nA grammar rule requires a left-hand side, which must be a single\nnonterminal, represented by a string.  Its right-hand side is typically an\narray.  For instance, the grammar rule M ::= M\nT has M as its left-hand side\nand the three-element array M, \n, and T as its right hand side.\n\n\nThe elements on the right hand side come in two types.  There are other\nnonterminals (such as M and T) and there are terminals (the symbol \n, in\nthis example).  Nonterminals are represented as strings, and terminals as\nregular expressions.  Thus to create the grammar rule M ::= M\nT, we would\nuse \n'M'\n as the left-hand side and \n[ 'M', /\\*/, 'T' ]\n as the right-hand\nside.\n\n\nOur complete example grammar can then be created as follows.\n\n\nG = new Grammar( 'P' );\nG.addRule( 'P', [ 'S' ] );\nG.addRule( 'S', [ 'S', /\\+/, 'M' ] );\nG.addRule( 'S', [ 'M' ] );\nG.addRule( 'M', [ 'M', /\\*/, 'T' ] );\nG.addRule( 'M', [ 'T' ] );\nG.addRule( 'T', [ /-?[0-9]+/ ] );\n\n\n\n\nThere are a few things to improve upon here.\n\n\n\n\nWe may combine rules that have the same left-hand side, just be listing\n    the right-hand sides one after the other.\n\n\nWe may express a one-element array containing a terminal by the regular\n    expression alone, omitting the enclosing array.\n\n\nWe may express a right-hand side consisting exclusively of one or more\n    nonterminals by writing it as a single string, with the names of the\n    nonterminals separated by spaces.\n\n\n\n\nThis reduces our grammar somewhat.\n\n\nG = new Grammar( 'P' );\nG.addRule( 'P', 'S' );\nG.addRule( 'S', [ 'S', /\\+/, 'M' ], 'M' );\nG.addRule( 'M', [ 'M', /\\*/, 'T' ], 'T' );\nG.addRule( 'T', /-?[0-9]+/ );\n\n\n\n\nThe P in this grammar is redundant; we could have left it out and declared\nour grammar to start with S, but I leave it in to be consistent with the\nWikipedia article from which it was taken.\n\n\nRunning the parser\n\n\nWe can then parse text by passing it to the grammar's \nparse\n member\nfunction.\n\n\n\nT = new Tokenizer();\nT.addType( /-?[0-9]+/ );\nT.addType( /[+*]/ );\nT.addType( /\\s/, function () { return null; } );\nG = new Grammar( 'P' );\nG.setOption( 'tokenizer', T );\n// Comment out either of these lines and re-run to see their effects:\nG.setOption( 'addCategories', false );\nG.setOption( 'collapseBranches', true );\nG.addRule( 'P', 'S' );\nG.addRule( 'S', [ 'S', /\\+/, 'M' ], 'M' );\nG.addRule( 'M', [ 'M', /\\*/, 'T' ], 'T' );\nG.addRule( 'T', /-?[0-9]+/ );\nJSON.stringify( G.parse( '15 + -2 * 9' ), null, 2 );\n\n\n\n\nThe result of the \nparse\n function is an array of valid parsings.  In this\ncase, it has only one element, because there is only one way the expression\ncould be parsed.  For more complex grammars with ambiguities, more than one\nresult may be returned.\n\n\nTo override options chosen with \nsetOption()\n, call the parse function with\nan optional second argument, an object whose keys and values override the\nexisting options.  Example:\n\n\nG.parse( 'text', { collapseBranches : true } );\n\n\n\n\nMiscellany\n\n\nThis module extends the global \nJSON\n object with a routine that can compare\ntwo JSON structures for structural equality.  Two atomic values are equal if\nthey are actually equal, two arrays are equal if they have the same lengths\nand their corresponding entries are equal, and two objects are equal if they\nhave the same keys and the corresponding values in each are equal.\n\n\n\nJSON.equals( [ 1, 2, { 3 : 4 } ], [ 1, 2, { 3 : 4 } ] );\n\n\n\n\n\nJSON.equals( { a : 5 }, { b : 5 } );\n\n\n\n\nMore Examples\n\n\nIn addition to the brief examples shown in this file, \nthe test suite in the\nsource code\nrepository\n\nis (naturally) a large set of examples of how the module works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvar elements = document.getElementsByClassName( 'runnable-example' );\nfor ( var i = 0 ; i < elements.length ; i++ ) {\n    var source = elements[i].textContent;\n    elements[i].textContent = '';\n    var notebook = RunKit.createNotebook( {\n        element: elements[i],\n        source: source,\n        preamble: 'Tokenizer = require( \"earley-parser\" ).Tokenizer;\\nGrammar = require( \"earley-parser\" ).Grammar;'\n    } );\n}",
